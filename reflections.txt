This project is quite the send off for the foundations course. Heartfelt thank you to everyone at 
THE ODIN PROJECT for putting all this together. 

It made me remember all the stuff I learned in Principles of Software back in RPI. 
Especially pertaining to object oriented programming. 

Using representation invariants was a key move to success.
Actually, I haven't turned logging on to check if it's still held in my last commit, oh well.

The project itself reminds me of all the CPU simulation code we had to build in Computer Organization, 
not a big fan of building logic flow charts / pseudocode.

Took me around 4,5,6 hours? Everything specified is met so I'm sure I'm done with this project. 
Something tells me this project isn't over. I'll appreciate any code reviews. 

Extra Credit? 

I don't know if I want to do extra credits right now, I'm so tired.

Well I just read the extra credits section. My representation invariant won't need changing. 
Floating point numbers and backspace features only seem to affect the display div element, so 
the parsing won't need changes (yes, I wrote my object with floats in mind).

Keyboard support? I just have to add event listeners for the keys. Functions will be the same.
